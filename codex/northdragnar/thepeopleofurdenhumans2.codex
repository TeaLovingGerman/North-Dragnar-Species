    "(...)
Since escape by spaceships and even teleportation were out of the question, the only hope for the colonists to survive, was a plan. A plan with which they could somehow endure or evade the planet's unbearable greenhouse age.

Different groups between the most educated and talented people of the colony, engineers, scientists, physicians and people out of many other fields, banded together to find a solution for the colonists' crisis.",

"Only two of these groups were able to pull through with their plans.

On one hand, there was the plan of setting up a station on the cold neighbouring planet, Fortuna, where a great part of the colonists could survive through cryostasis. The negative effects, that usually follow with freezing biological tissue, were nearly nullified by innovative works of former ''BIOneer'' staff members.",

"On the other hand, there was a group, initially formed and led by geologists of Urden's most prominent mining company, ''Plutus' Pickaxe'', who planned to retreat below the surface of the other neighbouring planet, closer to the system's sun, Sphinx.

Sphinx was previously deemed uninhabitable by the colonists, due to the incredibly hostile lifeforms on the planet's surface. However, recent scans showed that there were many resources and much less lifeforms below Sphinx's surface.",

"The colonists, who decided to go along this group's plan, fled to Sphinx's underground and prospered with time. They later returned as Sphinxian Dwarves to Plutus, which is now known as Urden, once the planet's climate became habitable again.
