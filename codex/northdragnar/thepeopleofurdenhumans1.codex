    "Urden was originally a planet uninhabited by any intelligent lifeforms, until it became home to a large group of human colonists.

Its climate was similar to that of Earth and offered many untouched sources of different materials. Therefore, ideal for a human colony.

An association of intergalatic climatologists though, identified that the planet was nearing a greenhouse age, which would soon prove problematic for the upkeep of the colony.",

"Unfortunately, the colony's most successful and wealthiest companies were using their influence on the planet's economy to lobby the government of the colony. Their strive for efficiency led them to nearly fully ignore the gradual climate change Urden was currently going through. The greenhouse gasses, released by the colony's many industries, only quickened the rise of Urden's temparature.

Plans for abandoning the colony were being worked on.",

"However, the so called ''Great Outtages'' laid ruin to the colonists' plans.

All communications with spaceships, systems beyond the colony's solar system as well as telepoter connections suddenly cut out on that fateful day. There have also been countless reports of flickering lights and briefly cut power to many different electric-powered appliances and equipment during the aforementioned events.",

"It was later discovered, that all the spaceships, which were entering or leaving the solar system, experienced complete system outtages, including emergency power supplies.

The following attempts, to escape the planet's imminent greenhouse age, proved to be fatal. Spaceships that tried to leave the solar system were never heard from again.

The cause of these ''Great Outtages'' could not be, and probably never will be, discovered any time soon.   (...)"
