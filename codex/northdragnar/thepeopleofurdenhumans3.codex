    "(...)
But neither the Humans from Fortuna nor the Sphinxian Dwarves were prepared for what they'd find back on Plutus.

Not even around a thousand years, meassured in Plutus' original planetary time, had passed for Plutus to return to a hospitable climate, as if it had already left the interglacial and ice age period.

Plutus was also now home to many new lifeforms, some of which were able to develop their own cultures.",

"These included, but were not limited to: the Many-Formed, Dragnar, Xar-Quar and even sentient mechanical beings such as Cronar, Farers and Vivachin.

Humans dealt with Urden's inhabitants in greatly varying measures. 

Many wanted to approach Urden's people diplomatically, to live peacefully among them.",

"Others however, didn't want to share the planet with other intelligent species. The group formed from these individuals called themselves the ''People of Plutus''. For them, Plutus remained their own home planet, which they wanted for themselves, or at least, wanted to rule over.

Many failed attempts, to convince other humans of this false privilege, led them to become more radical, which eventually made them infamous for their hatred towards other species and their desire, to rule over Urden with an iron fist.",

"Urden's people had to, more often than not, defend themselves against the ''People of Plutus''. This led to some of them developing hatred and distrust against humans as a whole, which made it all the more harder for human diplomats, to negotiate with them.

Still, most of humanity on Urden can manage to interact peacefully with Urden's people. It's also not uncommon to see Humans, that have been integrated into communities of Urden's people, who accepted them as equal."
