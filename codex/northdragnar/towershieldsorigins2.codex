    "[...]

There have been multiple protocols written during Sfitrfjol's speeches and tales. His insight in the actions of the Ronjat were invaluable to the North-Dragnarian rebels.

Though Sfitrfjol's knowledge about his former clan's plans was limited, due to him serving only as a guard rather than a member of the higher ranks.",

"While many of the protocols differ in smaller details, they all still contain the most important events of Sfitrfjol's life.

One of these important events was his isolation.

There, among other things, he was always told, that the North-Dragnar once ruled over the Ronjat's kin with an iron fist, so to speak.", 

"''Unruly'', ''savage'' and ''merciless'' were some of the keywords, that the other Ronjat used to describe the North-Dragnar, as Sfitrfjol told it to his listeners.

With these expectations, Sfitrfjol expected to encounter the worst the North-Dragnar would have to offer.",

"''Instead, as I was released from my isolation and saw the very first group of you (the North-Dragnar) I was not greeted by wild beasts, that once sought to kill my clan, but with exhausted people, four times smaller than me, who trembled at the very sight of me.

At that moment I did not feel like the grand protector I was always told to be.''",

"Following this discovery came the brutality of his fellow guards.

''Your people (the North-Dragnar) were punished for the smallest of mistakes, killed and some were even eaten alive by those I deemed kin.

Then, when I witnessed, what one of the guards was about to do in his drunken rage, I snapped. I rammed him with my shield, onto the ground, as he was trying to swing his axe at a group of Dragnar.",

"It was too late.

His axe had already struck the huddled group and killed most of them.
Their fearful screams chilled me to the very bone.

Before I could stand up and confront the killer, my actions were answered by curses and a swift scratch of his claws along the right side of my face.
