    "[...]

His sudden attack caught me off-guard and made me lose grip of my shield and spear.

He threw away my spear, cried out ''Traitor'' and prepared himself for another strike, while the other guards came along to help him.

Once he blurted that word, they knew, that I was no longer on their side.",

"The fight that followed, I remember too little of it.
I do remember what came afterwards.

In front of me, the lifeless bodies of Ronjat guardspeople.

My shield, scratched and red from bludgeoning my former kin.

Beside me, the unfortunate victims of the drunken guard's rage.

Behind me, North-Dragnar who sought shelter from the fight.", 

"Your people (the North-Dragnar) gathered around the fight's remains, they appeared scared, yet hopeful.

After providing the deceased Dragnar a burial by fire, to pay them our respect, we gathered as many materials from the encampment as possible and took to the woods during the night.",

"And the former guards, we stripped them from any equipment that could have aided us in the future and left their bodies to rot.

We left them for a message to the Ronjat.

To show them, that all their training and isolation did not prevent me from turning against them.

To show them, that their enemies grew more powerful.",

"Sfitrfjol later continued to aid the North-Dragnar, by joining some significant offenses, while also protecting them during raids of the Ronjat's warriors. 

Multiple sources make mention of Sfitrfjol's large shield, which reached from the ground up to his shoulders. It is claimed, that he also shielded his companions from a great number of fatal blows, dealt by his former kin.",

"His shield's size and his great efforts to protect the North-Dragnar earned him the name Sfitrfjol Tower-Shield.

Shortly after the passing of Sfitrfjol, his close companions decided to serve their people as protectors against further aggressions. They named their new-founded organization after their greatest inspiration, Sfitrfjol.

Thus the Tower-Shields came to be and protect their people to this very day."
