    "Many travellers, who have passed through a North-Dragnarian town or village, encountered, with no doubt, a member of the Tower-Shields along the way.

While many, who aren't North-Dragnar themselves, might think, that the Tower-Shields are simply the guardspeople of the North-Dragnarian people, in actuality they are a much greater organization with a deep-rooted history, which reaches beyond the North-Dragnar's very first journey to the stars.",

"The organization's name was inspired by the actions of Sfitrfjol, initially a member of the infamous Ronjat, the oppressors of the North-Dragnar, who kindled the North-Dragnarian uprising like many other renowned heroes and heroines.

He was trained by other capable Ronjat and his rapidly improving prowess in combat was admired by the different ranks of his clan. Sfitrfjol's tasks consisted of protecting the Ronjat's clan members as one of their royal guards.",

"A notable amount of the Ronjat's documents mention his potential in securing their position as rulers over the North-Dragnar.

The following is a translated excerpt from a letter sent by Jathzi, one of the most influential Ronjat, to an unknown addressee, in which she expressed her concerns regarding Sfitrfjol:",

"''[...] If we were not to isolate him (Sfitrfjol) from our subjects, there is the possibility, that he might question his loyalty to our cause. As you (the unknown addressee) know, it is unfortunately not uncommon, that one of our supposedly dutiful subordinates backstabbed us.

We were able to take proper action for most of their treachery, [...] but if he were to sympathize with our subjects and turn on us, they would gain a powerful ally, while we would lose a capable protector.",

"We need to always keep him under our watch. 

No Excuses.''

Sfitrfjol was indeed not the first Ronjat, who had turned against his clan. In addition to being isolated from the North-Dragnar the Ronjat also ordered a few of their clan's most loyal guards to ''keep him under the (Ronjat's) watch''.",

"In the end, these measures proved to be reason why Sfitrfjol started to doubt his clan's intentions.

After Sfitrfjol left the Ronjat, to join the North-Dragnar in their uprisings, many dedicated North-Dragnar wrote down the stories Sfitrfjol told to his new-found companions.
