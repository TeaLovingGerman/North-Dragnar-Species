		"Your species is a curious one, you know?",
		"Does the colour blue have any significant meaning to your species? It must have!",
		"What kind of alloy is North-Dragnarian brass made of? Its sturdiness and heat-resistance are impressive!",
		"Even my processors can not handle your accent at times. How strange..."
