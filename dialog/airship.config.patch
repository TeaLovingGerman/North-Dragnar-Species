        "Welcome aboard, Dragnar!",
        "How did you get all the way up here?",
        "Keep your hands off our supplies and we won't have any problems.",
        "If you want supplies, you should speak to our quartermaster.",
        "Haven't seen you on board before.",
        "You a new crew member?",
        "Watch your step on deck, it can get a bit rough in windy conditions.",
        "Make sure you behave yourself.",
        "You here to trade?",
        "It has its challenges, but life as an aeronaut is great!",

        "Right here in the open skies, this is where I belong!",
        "You'd best not be eyeing our stuff!",
        "You ever consider getting an eyepatch?",
        "The view from the main deck is quite something!",
        "Any funny business and it'll be the brig for you!",
        "Looking for supplies? Go see the quartermaster.",
        "What do you think of our ship?",
        "When I tell people I live on a ship, they always assume I have scurvy.",
        "All these propellers require so much upkeep!",
        "I wonder how my family is doing.",
        "I'm new here, but I'm finding my skyfaring legs!",
        "You seem a capable sort, ever considered the skyfaring life?",
        "Life on an airship isn't all it's cracked up to be.",
        "Every day it's the same old routine.",
        "The ship is nice and all, but the food is terrible! Know how to cook?",
        "This ship has seen better days, but it's my home.",
        "You lost?",
        "We got some great supplies from our last stop!",
        "For some, it's about the money. For me, it's about the adventure!",
        "We see a lot of exciting stuff in our line of work, but it can be dangerous too!",
        "I'd best not catch you pilfering anything!",
        "Keep your hands where I can see them...",
        "If supplies are what you want, go see the quartermaster.",
        "One whiff of disrespect and I will end you!",
        "We're a merchant vessel by trade, but don't think that makes us pushovers.",
        "You definetly look like you've been in a scrap or two.",
		"I guess that your kind's not used to being on board of a skyfaring airship, are they?",
		"Do North-Dragnar have flying longships like our airships?",
		"I'm fine with someone like you on board.",
		"We mostly avoid North-Dragnarian raiders. Sometimes though, there's no other option than to fight.",
		"Just like us, your kind is not getting fooled by Kluex's fanatics!",
		"You don't have to worry about the Stargazer's influence here, Dragnar.",
		"Kluex's priests would deem our method of flying blasphemy, for sure. I call it living a free life!",
		"We don't ever plan on raiding places, don't you worry. This is a merchant vessel after all.",
		"Isn't it tradition, that North-Dragnarian raiders observe a place before attacking, to deem, if it's worth to raid?",
		"Who'd be stronger? An entire airship of Avian aeronauts or a whole longship of North-Dragnarian raiders? Just wondering..."
